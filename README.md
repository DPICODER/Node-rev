# Node Rev — Backend Revision & Learning Lab

A personal backend engineering lab focused on revising Node.js fundamentals and learning production-style backend architecture step by step.

This repository is not a single app — it is a **structured learning workspace** where each phase builds real backend skills through hands-on implementation.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:

* Revisit backend fundamentals with Node.js & Express
* Learn real-world backend architecture patterns
* Build clean, maintainable API structure
* Practice security best practices
* Replace cluttered beginner code with simplified, scalable patterns

This project emphasizes **understanding architecture**, not just making things work.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned So Far

### Error Handling Architecture

* Centralized error middleware
* Throwing structured errors with status codes
* Clean error propagation using `next(error)`
* Consistent API error responses

### Sequelize Model Design

* Proper schema design
* Model associations (User ↔ Asset ↔ Allocation relationships)
* Scoped queries and relational integrity
* Instance-level CRUD operations

### Authentication System

* User registration & login flow
* Secure password hashing with bcrypt hooks
* JWT-based authentication
* Protected routes using auth middleware
* `/auth/me` endpoint for session validation

### Asset CRUD Architecture

* Full Asset CRUD implementation
* Role-based admin authorization
* Joi schema validation pipeline
* Pagination engine with metadata responses
* Filtering by category/status
* Sorting with safe field whitelisting
* Controller-driven REST design

### Allocation System Architecture

* Transaction-safe asset assignment
* Row-level locking to prevent race conditions
* Asset lifecycle state management
* Allocation history tracking
* Relational joins with eager loading
* Input validation middleware
* Business rule enforcement (availability checks)
* Atomic multi-table updates

### Middleware System

* Authentication middleware
* Role-based authorization middleware
* Joi validation middleware pipeline
* Allocation validation middleware
* Centralized error middleware
* Clean middleware ordering

### API Query Engine

* Pagination using limit/offset
* Dynamic filtering system
* Safe sorting architecture
* Scalable query composition
* Joined relational queries

### Code Structure Improvements

* Separation of concerns (routes → controllers → models)
* Modular controller architecture
* Simplified readable logic
* Professional folder architecture
